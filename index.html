								<h3>The Silicon Sentinel: AIâ€™s Double-Edged Sword in Cybersecurity</h3>
								<p class="justified-text"> 
									â€¢ This research explores the dual role of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in cybersecurity, examining its use as both a security tool and a weapon for attackers. On the positive side, AI enhances cybersecurity by quickly detecting behavioral changes, safeguarding networks, and managing IoT devices. Its ability to analyze large data sets at high speed helps identify threats like unusual traffic patterns, fraudulent links, and other cyber risks faster than humans. However, AI can also be exploited by cybercriminals to create realistic phishing emails, videos, and malware, increasing attack sophistication and evasion of detection. This paper discusses the risks and challenges of using AI in cybersecurity, advocating for a systematic approach to maximize its benefits while addressing its potential downsides.
									</p>

								<h3>Digital Haven: Innovations and Strategies for Securing Cloud Platforms</h3>
									<p class="justified-text"> 
										â€¢ Cloud computing is an important technology for organizations that offers the possibilities
										of flexible, scalable and cheap solutions for storing and processing data. However, with such
										tremendous advancement in cloud services, new and advanced security threats include ran-
										somware attacks, data breach, and internal threats. These risks are the result of new forms of
										threats, and traditional security methods, which are based on the protection of the perimeter of
										the networks, are insufficient for their overcoming. To this end, this paper discusses new secu-
										rity paradigms such as AI security, threat intelligence, Zero Trust security, and data encryption
										to tackle these challenges. This paper also takes time to examine how the issue of governance
										and policies are critical in establishing guidelines that enhance the implementation of security
										measures to meet regulatory requirements as well as industry standards. The paper thus re-
										views literature published in the last five years and provides organizational recommendations
										for improving the security of cloud computing systems. Its purpose is to assist organizations
										in building stable, protected cloud environments that can meet the increasing security needs of
										the existing environment.
